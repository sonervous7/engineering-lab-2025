#  🚀 engineering-lab-2025
### *A personal engineering lab for algorithms, ML, RAG, agents, and software engineering.*

## 🎯 Purpose

**learning-lab** is my long-term personal workspace where I build real engineering skills by practicing:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** in both Python and C++  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** fundamentals  
- **NLP, RAG systems, and LLM engineering**  
- **AI agents and tool-use workflows**  
- **Software engineering**: tests, CI/CD, Docker, architecture  
- **Technical notes** and self-explanations

This is **not** a polished portfolio.  
This is a **training ground** — a place to learn, break things, fix things, understand deeply, and grow steadily as an engineer.

## 📘 Goals

Over time, this repository will grow into:

### 100 (50 x 2) algorithm challenges ![](https://geps.dev/progress/9)
(in Python & C++)

### PyTorch fundamentals  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
(training loops, models, datasets)

### An end-to-end ML pipeline  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
(EDA → preprocessing → model → metrics → API)

### A full RAG system  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
(chunking → embeddings → vector DB → retriever → generator)

### Tools & AI agents  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
(tool calling, workflows, memory)

### Strong software engineering fundamentals  ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
(CI/CD, testing, Docker, logging)
